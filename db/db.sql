  -- Sample materialized path implementation of a tree in SQL 
    -- 
    -- The materialized path is a string containing the path to the node 
    -- represented by the node ids along the path separated by / characters. 
    -- This string is easy to search using the LIKE comparison function 
    -- to check for path characteristics. All the methods that apply to the 
    -- adjacency list representation can also be used with this format. 
    -- The path string is maintained automatically by triggers. Any node 
    -- inserted with a NULL parent_id is the root of a new tree.
